The war in Palestine has caused massive destruction, adding to Gaza’s ongoing challenges with infrastructure and electricity. Recent damage from the conflict has resulted in a decrease in clean water and sewage treatment services, as well as power shortages ranging from 18-20 hours a day. 

Today, only 10% of Gazans have access to safe drinking water. Along with a dire need for clean and filtered water, there is also a shortage of medication and medical equipment. Muslim Aid USA is working on the ground to provide safe and sustainable water and sanitation to communities in Gaza in greatest need. Our team is also delivering medical supplies and equipment to Al Amal Hospital. 

Our aim with this project is to reduce the risk of flooding and contamination in the Al-Nasr and Al-Satar neighborhoods in Gaza, by improving community-level water infrastructure. MAUSA will be installing wastewater UPV pipelines, further increasing access to hygiene and sanitation, while also creating temporary employment opportunities for locals
