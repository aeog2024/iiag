UPA is a 501(c) (3) New York-registered non-profit organization, with headquarters in Washington, DC, and works in the occupied Palestinian territories and refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon. Established in 1978 in New York by Palestinian-American professionals, UPA was conceived as a non-political, non-sectarian organization that would help Palestinians meet their relief and development needs.

UPA is committed to disbursing funds responsibly and efficiently. It also works with capable, credible partner organizations that have demonstrated the ability to accomplish the goal of any UPA-provided grant. Board members and key personnel of partner organizations undergo a regular and rigorous vetting process to protect UPA resources from diversion or exploitation to purposes other than specified in the grant documents.

Charity Navigator has given UPA its highest rating – four stars – for financial health, accountability, and transparency for the last eight years. UPA meets all 20 Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance standards and has earned the Guidestar Platinum Seal of Transparency.
