Individuals listed by [Canary Mission](https://canarymission.org/) have said it is a blacklist designed to intimidate students, 
faculty members, and community activists engaged in Palestine solidarity work. 
Some pro-Israel activists consider the site's tactics to be overly aggressive, while others applaud 
its efforts against pro-Palestinian activists.

The *Canary Mission* represents a threat to free speech and political organizing in the U.S. By targeting graduate and undergraduate students and professors, the website ruins reputations and professional careers of those who dare to criticize Israel's oppressive methods. It is particularly alarming knowing that law enforcement in Israel and U.S. is relying on this website to target Palestinian rights activists (Rothchild, 2020). 

This shadowy website will declare individuals as *anti-Israel conspiracy theorists* and *provocateurs*. It is alarming to see the large number of jewish academics who are targeted as being *dangerous, lying, and self-hating Jews*. The most vulnerable targeted groups being students of color and Arabs.

As the website is anonymous, its creators and contributors can be considered as cyber bullies. The difference being that their harrassing and harmful actions would not be pursuit by justice. In 2018, the [Grayzone Project](https://thegrayzone.com/) identified the Canary Mission's domain owner as Howard Davis Sterling, a lawyer and passionate Israel supporter ( [The Grayzone, 2018](https://thegrayzone.com/2018/08/22/meet-the-owner-of-canary-missions-anonymous-anti-palestinian-blacklisting-website/) ). A censored Al Jazeera film named an Israeli-American real estate investor, [Adam Milstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Milstein), as the funer of Canary Mission. 

The Canary Mission is part of a multimillion dollar network of trolling and disinformation organizations such as :
- [AMCHA](https://amchainitiative.org/)
- [CAMERA](https://www.camera.org/)
- [David Horowitz Freedom Center](https://www.horowitzfreedomcenter.org/)
- [Israel on Campus Coalition](https://israelcc.org/)
- [Israellycool](https://www.israellycool.com/)
- [Stand with Us](https://www.standwithus.com/)
- [Students Supporting Israel](https://www.ssimovement.org/)
These organizations monitor social and printed media as well as webzines. Their goal is to muzzle and intimidate critics, suppress support for the [BDS movement](https://bdsmovement.net/), and distract the general population from the serious human rights violations in Palestine.
