The Wonderful Company has been criticized for its excessive consumption of water in the state of California and blamed for corruption, bribing state officials and politicians. 

The Resnicks, who own The Wonderful Company, have donated substantial sums annually to the Israeli Occupation Forces, primarily via the American Friends of the Israeli Defense Forces. Between 2015 and 2022, their contributions amounted to approximately $2.4 million. ( Source: [The Canary](https://www.thecanary.co/global/world-analysis/2025/01/13/the-resnicks-la-california/))
