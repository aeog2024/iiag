> One star who was not afraid of contesting the view of the Hollywood Establishment was Vanessa Redgrave (The Palestinian, 1977), whose 1978 Oscars speech (for Zinnemann’s Julia, 1977) criticising the ‘Zionist hoodlums’ who had, among other things, campaigned against her nomination, led to her vilification in the industry. According to the authors, who dwell upon writer Paddy Chayefsky’s stinging riposte and Redgrave’s shunning at the Oscars after-party, ‘Not one Hollywood figure came out in support of Redgrave’. Shaw and Goodman certainly create a dramatic moment—only it was not quite true. Chayefsky’s attack on Redgrave was part of his awards presentation speech for Best Screenplay. He had to give an award to Julia’s Jewish screenwriter, Alvin Sargent, who looked the crowd in the eye and said, ‘I like to think that this Oscar represents ... the free expression of all our good thoughts and feelings and loves no matter who we are or what we have to say’. Unfortunately, Hollywood’s record of allowing free expression in film is mediocre at best, and the book shows evidence of pro-Israeli efforts to police film content on everything from speculative scripts and the writings of John le Carré to the Bible.
