> Selon le droit international, une armée d'occupation, même si elle combat une organisation criminelle, est responsable du sort de la population civile dans ses zones d'opération et d'occupation. <br> <br> [Omer Bartov - New York Times 10/11/2023]


> There is no war in Gaza. The IDF is in control and there is no organized resistance. (...) What the IDF is doing thre is destroying Gaza. (...) The reports by soldiers is that they have never seen such a devastation. (...) It looks like Hiroshima, like Germany at the end of the second world war. What is it trying to accomplish? (...) It's a war of annihilation of the entire Gaza strip with focus on the north. <br> <br> [Omer Bartov on CNN - 19/12/2024]
