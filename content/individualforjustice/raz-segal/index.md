## A "textbook case of genocide"

In the context of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, the subsequent Israeli counteroffensive and complete blockade, which included the denial of water, food, power, and fuel to the civilian population of the Gaza Strip, Segal described it as a "textbook case of genocide" and connected it to the Nakba, the expulsion of Palestinians during the establishment of Israel in 1948.
