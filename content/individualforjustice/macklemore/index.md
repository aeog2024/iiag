"HIND'S HALL" <br><br>
<br>
Woo<br>
Yeah, the people, they won't leave<br>
What is threatenin' about divesting and wantin' peace?<br>
The problem isn't the protests, it's what they're protestin'<br>
It goes against what our country is fundin' (Hey)<br>
Block the barricade until Palestine is free (Hey)<br>
Block the barricade until Palestine is free<br>
When I was seven, I learned a lesson from Cube and Eazy-E<br>
What was it again? Oh yeah, fuck the police (Woo)<br><br>
<br>
Actors in badges protecting property<br>
And a system that was designed by white supremacy (Brrt)<br>
But the people are in the streets<br>
You can pay off Meta, you can't pay off me<br>
Politicians who serve by any means<br>
AIPAC, CUFI, and all the companies<br>
You see, we sell fear around the land of the free<br>
But this generation here is about to cut the strings<br>
You can ban TikTok, take us out the algorithm<br>
But it's too late, we've seen the truth, we bear witness<br>
Seen the rubble, the buildings, the mothers and the children<br>
And all the men that you murdered and then we see how you spin it<br>
Who gets the right to defend and who gets the right of resistance<br>
Has always been about dollars and the color of your pigment, but<br>
White supremacy is finally on blast<br>
Screamin' "Free Palestine" 'til they're home at last (Woo)<br><br>
<br>
We see the lies in them, claimin' it's antisemitic to be anti-Zionist<br>
I've seen Jewish brothers and sisters out there and ridin' in<br>
Solidarity and screamin' "Free Palestine" with them<br>
Organizin', unlearnin' and finally cuttin' ties with<br>
A state that's gotta rely on an apartheid system to uphold an occupyin' violent<br>
History been repeating for the last seventy-five<br>
The Nakba never ended, the colonizer lied (Woo)<br>
If students in tents posted on the lawn<br>
Occupyin' the quad is really against the law<br>
And a reason to call in the police and their squad<br>
Where does genocide land in your definition, huh? (Hey; hey)<br>
Destroyin' every college in Gaza and every mosque<br>
Pushin' everyone into Rafah and droppin' bombs<br>
The blood is on your hands, Biden, we can see it all<br>
And fuck no, I'm not voting for you in the fall (Woo)<br>
Undecided, you can't twist the truth, the people out here united<br>
Never be defeated when freedom's on the horizon<br>
Yet the music industry's quiet, complicit in their platform of silence (Hey, woo)<br><br>
<br>
What happened to the artist? What do you got to say?<br>
If I was on a label, you could drop me today<br>
I'd be fine with it 'cause the heart fed my page<br>
I want a ceasefire, fuck a response from Drake (Woo)<br>
What you willin' to risk? What you willin' to give?<br>
What if you were in Gaza? What if those were your kids?<br>
If the West was pretendin' that you didn't exist<br>
You'd want the world to stand up and the students finally did, let's get it (Woo)<br><br>
<br>
Brrt<br>
Woo <br>

"HIND'S HALL 2"<br>
(feat. Anees, MC Abdul, & Amer Zahr)<br><br>
<br>
In our lifetime we will be free<br>
One day when the light shines we will be free<br>
In our lifetime we will be free<br>
And they can bury us<br>
But they will find out we are seeds<br>
Oo-ohhh, Oo-ohhh<br>
Oo-ohhh (Louder), Oo-ohhh<br>
They can bury us<br>
But they will find out we are seeds<br><br>
<br>
I say free Falasteen because I know of every massacre we suffered<br>
The Nakba, Sabra, Shatila, Rafah<br>
My people have died a million times in their struggles<br>
'Til they rise from the tides<br>
Like a rose through the rubble<br>
I see God himself in the eye of a refugee<br>
Who rather die a martyr than live a life under siege<br>
So if I'm not allowed to say from the river to the sea<br>
Then from the rind to the seed Palestine will be free<br>
Still, they know they can't shake us<br>
Billion-dollar sword to that neck<br>
Death cannot break us<br>
In every Palestinian refugee holds a key<br>
One day we will return<br>
No matter how long it takes us<br><br>
<br>
In our lifetime we will be free<br>
One day when the light shines we will be free<br>
In our lifetime we will be free<br>
And they can bury us<br>
But they will find out we are seeds<br>
Oo-ohhh, Oo-ohhh<br>
Oo-ohhh (Louder), Oo-ohhh<br>
They can bury us<br>
But they will find out we are seeds<br><br>
<br>
(Yeah, yeah)<br>
I've seen massacres, I'm grateful to be alive<br>
You appreciate life when you survive a genocide<br>
Look in my eyes and tell me what you see<br>
Ran out of tears to cry, rap 'til Palestine is free<br>
Got a problem with the system that doesn't want us existing<br>
Turn this city to a prison that's missing living conditions<br>
My moms calling, she's telling me she's kinda scared<br>
I hear the bombs fallin', I smell the death up in the air<br>
My uncle lost his children, I lost my cousins<br>
His tears water their graves to let them know he still loves 'em<br>
Our schools turn to shelters for the rich and poor<br>
I just pray for peace<br>
When I speak, I don't wish for war<br>
Bodies layin' out, ain't nothing to play about<br>
I give my people hope 'cause I'm the first who made it out<br>
I'm just walking the path, this is God's plan<br>
Building up my dreams with the rubble, I touched with my hands<br><br>
<br>
Fee hayatna min koon hureen<br>
Il ma' il noor we minkom horeen<br>
Fee hayatna min koon hureen<br>
Law dafanoona nirja' mizhireen<br>
From the river to the sea<br>
Palestine will be free (Louder)<br>
From the river to the sea<br>
Palestine will be free (Louder)<br><br>
<br>
They done woke up the world now<br>
We know who you serve at the White House<br>
To kids in Gaza my vow right now<br>
I'ma ride for your life like you were my child<br>
Long live the resistance if there's something to resist<br>
Had enough of you motherfuckers murdering little kids<br>
PC for a minute, I was trynna be a bridge<br>
But there'll never be freedom by pleading with Zionists<br>
World screaming, "Free Palestine"<br>
We see the manual we know how you colonize<br>
You'd be surprised by how many fucks we actually really don't give<br>
When you take away that power of the all-mighty dollar sign<br>
Fuck the allure, we'll boycott the stores<br>
Capitalism killing us that's something we can't afford<br>
They want us to hate each other in the interest of war<br>
Afraid of the mosque and afraid to like them Anor<br>
Hey Kamala, I don't know if you listening<br>
But stop sending money and weapons you ain't winning Michigan<br>
We uncommitted, and hell no we ain't switching positions<br>
Because the whole world turned Palestinian<br>
I see them murdered children in Gaza and I see my babies<br>
Life being stripped from the bombs we're making<br>
When will Congress decide a Palestinian's life is just as precious as an Israeli's<br>
We don't own the earth, don't own the earth<br>
We're killing each other over some lines in the dirt<br>
We bleed the same blood, feel the same hurt<br>
Palestinian life, does it have the same worth?<br>
What happened to us?<br>
What happened to us?<br><br>
<br>
Fee hayatna min koon hureen<br>
Il ma' il noor we minkom horeen<br>
Fee hayatna min koon hureen<br>
Law dafanoona nirja' mizhireen<br>
From the river to the sea<br>
Palestine will be free (Louder)<br>
From the river to the sea<br>
Palestine will be free (Louder) <br>
